# Birthday-Reminder
This is a birthday reminder app built using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. With this app, users can input birthdays for their friends and family members, and the app will remind them of upcoming birthdays. The app stores birthdays in a database and checks the current date to generate reminders. It also includes a form for users to input new birthdays, a list of upcoming birthdays, and a way to set reminders. This app was built as a personal project to showcase my skills in front-end web development using React and related tools.
